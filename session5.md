This document lists the topics to be discussed in the fifth session of the workshop, linking out to the databases tutorial.


Topics:

- [Setting up an SQLite database](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-databases/db-management#1-sqlite)
- [Setting up a PostgreSQL database](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-databases/db-management#2-postgresql)
   - We'll need to do this on a Linux machine, so one convenient approach is to use a Docker container (a container is sort of like a virtual machine but less self-contained and easier to work with). There are some instructions in [docker.sh](https:///berkeley-scf.github.io/sql-databases-2022/docker.sh) that we'll demo.
